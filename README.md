|star-align.sh | This is a SLURM job script that runs the STAR RNA-seq aligner on the cluster of Uni Wien. It requests 1 node, 16 CPU threads, 20 GB RAM, and up to 12 hours to align paired-end FASTQ reads (SRR23260644_1.fastq and SRR23260644_2.fastq)  against a pre-built STAR genome index. It outputs a coordinate-sorted BAM file (alignment) and writes logs/errors to the specified logs/ directory, with email notifications on job end/fail. This SLURM batch script performs RNA-seq read alignment by taking raw paired-end FASTQ files and mapping them to a reference genome with the STAR aligner using a pre-built STAR genome index specified by --genomeDir (index generation is not performed in this script). The job requests one node with 16 CPU threads, 20 GB of memory, and a 12-hour time limit, and it produces a coordinate-sorted BAM alignment file along with STAR log and summary outputs. The resulting alignment files are used as input for downstream analyses such as alignment quality assessment, gene-level read quantification for expression analysis, splice junction detection and alternative splicing analysis, and visualization of read coverage in genome browsers.  |
| fastqc.sh | This SLURM batch script runs a FastQC quality-control check on raw paired-end sequencing reads (FASTQ files) on the Uni Wien cluster by requesting one compute node, 2 CPU threads, 2 GB of memory, and up to 1 hour of runtime, then writing the FastQC reports to a designated QC results directory. It loads the required software environment via the module system, records the job start time in the log, and executes fastqc with two threads to generate summary metrics and visual diagnostics (HTML/ZIP outputs) describing read quality, base composition, adapter/overrepresented sequence signals, and other common sequencing artifacts. This step is used to evaluate whether the raw data are of sufficient quality for downstream analyses and to guide preprocessing decisions (e.g., whether adapter or quality trimming is needed) before proceeding to computationally intensive steps such as read alignment and quantification.   |
