|star-align.sh | This is a SLURM job script that runs the STAR RNA-seq aligner on the cluster of Uni Wien. It requests 1 node, 16 CPU threads, 20 GB RAM, and up to 12 hours to align paired-end FASTQ reads (SRR23260644_1.fastq and SRR23260644_2.fastq)  against a pre-built STAR genome index. It outputs a coordinate-sorted BAM file (alignment) and writes logs/errors to the specified logs/ directory, with email notifications on job end/fail. This SLURM batch script performs RNA-seq read alignment by taking raw paired-end FASTQ files and mapping them to a reference genome with the STAR aligner using a pre-built STAR genome index specified by --genomeDir (index generation is not performed in this script). The job requests one node with 16 CPU threads, 20 GB of memory, and a 12-hour time limit, and it produces a coordinate-sorted BAM alignment file along with STAR log and summary outputs. The resulting alignment files are used as input for downstream analyses such as alignment quality assessment, gene-level read quantification for expression analysis, splice junction detection and alternative splicing analysis, and visualization of read coverage in genome browsers.  |
| fastqc.sh | This SLURM batch script runs a FastQC quality-control check on raw paired-end sequencing reads (FASTQ files) on the Uni Wien cluster by requesting one compute node, 2 CPU threads, 2 GB of memory, and up to 1 hour of runtime, then writing the FastQC reports to a designated QC results directory. It loads the required software environment via the module system, records the job start time in the log, and executes fastqc with two threads to generate summary metrics and visual diagnostics (HTML/ZIP outputs) describing read quality, base composition, adapter/overrepresented sequence signals, and other common sequencing artifacts. This step is used to evaluate whether the raw data are of sufficient quality for downstream analyses and to guide preprocessing decisions (e.g., whether adapter or quality trimming is needed) before proceeding to computationally intensive steps such as read alignment and quantification.   |
| trim-exos.sh   | This SLURM batch script was used to preprocess paired-end reads from an exosome sequencing experiment produced by T-Technologies Grundalgenforschung e.U. that had been reported as very noisy, with the goal of improving data quality enough to “rescue” usable signal for downstream analysis. The job loads Trimmomatic on the Uni Wien cluster, allocates 1 node with 4 CPU threads and 12 GB RAM, creates an output directory, and then runs Trimmomatic in paired-end mode on the compressed FASTQ inputs (`Exos_R1.fastq.gz` and `Exos_R2.fastq.gz`). During preprocessing it removes standard Illumina TruSeq paired-end adapter sequences (`ILLUMINACLIP`), trims low-quality regions using a sliding window approach (window size 4, minimum average Phred score 20), and discards reads shorter than 50 bp (`MINLEN:50`), while producing a summary report of how many reads were retained and how many were removed. The resulting cleaned read files are intended for subsequent alignment to the *Sus scrofa* reference genome, since the exosomes in this experiment originate from pig, and trimming helps reduce noise and technical artifacts that can otherwise lower mapping rates and compromise interpretation.
    | star_align-exos.sh  | This SLURM batch script aligns the cleaned paired-end reads from the T-Technologies Grundalgenforschung e.U. exosome sequencing experiment to the pig reference genome (*Sus scrofa*) using the STAR aligner. The script takes the “paired-surviving” reads (`Exos__1P` and `Exos__2P`) and maps them against a pre-built pig STAR genome index (`pig_STAR_index`) using 16 CPU threads, producing a coordinate-sorted BAM file as output. This step is used because exosome RNA sequencing data are often noisy and contain technical artifacts; alignment provides a concrete way to assess whether biologically meaningful pig-derived RNA is present by measuring mapping rates, identifying which genomic regions or genes receive read support, and generating an alignment file that can be used for downstream analyses such as expression quantification, detection of contamination (e.g., many unmapped reads), and visualization of coverage and spliced alignments. In practice, running STAR on the trimmed exosome reads helps determine whether the dataset can be “rescued” by showing that a sufficient fraction of reads still map reliably to the *Sus scrofa* genome and can support interpretable RNA-seq results.
